# Puzzle and Dragons Timer

This is a simple Chrome/Vivaldi extension to keep track of your stamina in Puzzle and Dragons. Your stamina is indicated on the extension's button. The timer also allows you to set push notification alerts when you have a certain amount of stamina, or at a certain time of day.

# Installing

Drag the `.crx` file from the `dist` folder onto [the extensions page](chrome://extensions). Alternatively you can build the extension yourself by running

```sh
npm install
gulp sass
```

and then loading the unpacked extension from the extensions page.
